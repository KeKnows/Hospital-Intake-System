#I think using a tree for the doctor structure is perfect. Each doctor can have their own reports, and the hierarchy is clear, kind of like how I organize my pasta and protein meals—everything in its place and easy to find. In this tree, the root is like the head doctor, and every doctor below has reports that branch off, which mirrors real-world hospital hierarchies. Preorder, inorder, and postorder traversals all make sense depending on what you want to do. Preorder is useful if you need to process the senior doctor first and then move down to their reports, like sending instructions top-down. Postorder is great if you want to process junior doctors first and then summarize for the senior doctor, which is more of a bottom-up approach. Inorder is useful if you need to process things in a certain order, like reviewing doctors from left to right in a structured way.

#Heaps are amazing for emergency queues because they make sure the most urgent patients are always seen first. A min-heap organizes patients by urgency, so a patient with a lower score (higher priority) is always at the root, ready to be treated immediately. This is kind of like how I prioritize protein in my meals—getting the most important thing first. Using heaps ensures real-time decision-making in the emergency room is fast, organized, and fair. Overall, trees and heaps together make perfect sense: they keep things structured, efficient, and high-priority items always at the forefront, just like my meals and protein routines.
